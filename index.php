		<p>Nectarines are native to China and are one of the oldest fruits around, dating back several thousands years ago. It is now the second most grown fruit trees worldwide, after apple, due to its favorable aromatic flavour.

There are thousands of cultivars but most of them are usually yellow with shades of red or pink on its smooth fuzz-less skin. Those with velvety fuzzy skin are known as peaches but they are actually of the same species as one single tree may produce both type of fruits.

Both types of the skin are edible. Its flesh is either white or yellow. White flesh is usually sweeter whereas the yellow flesh is more acidic but it may differ too depending on the cultivars. The photos shown above are the yellow fleshed nectarines. There is also another type with the unusual flattened shape, the pan tao or donut nectarine/peach.

As nectarines have fuzzless skin, they tend to look redder and also bruise easier than peaches. On size wise, nectarines are usually smaller than peaches.

Nectarines can be either clingstones or freestones, meaning that the flesh sticking to the stones or not. Most of the clingstone nectarines are meant for canning. Freestone nectarines are better off as fresh fruits.

There is a single brown seed encased in a woody pit or stone. The seed tastes bitter as it contains cyanide. Avoid eating it as it is harmful when taken in large doses.

Nectarine; Prunus persica; Amygdalus; Prunoideae; Rosaceae.</p>
